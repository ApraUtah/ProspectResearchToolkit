1," ""Overkill Problem"""," ""Request Management"""," ""Requests come in from front-line fundraisers that are not appropriate for the stage of the prospect at hand. If they haven't ever talked with a prospect, and they want contact information and an entire novel on the prospect's history, that may be overkill considering they are not yet qualified. This is a constant push and pull between fundraisers and prospect dev folk - and can be a pretty gnarly problem. If you don't negotiate the standards for the kind of research you provide, when you provide it, and what precipitates the necessity of that research - those standards will be assumed and decided for you ad hoc by fundraisers - and you will be buried in research that they may not even use. So there's some compromise that needs to happen."""," """"",,

3,"""Prospect Enigma""","""Deep Research""","""The more wealth someone has, the more resources they have (e.g. via lawyers and financial consultants). Most people don't have the time or knowledge to effectively remove their information from data brokers, but it is much more common among wealthy people that guard their privacy and employ resources to do so. If a prospect is an 'enigma' - it usually means their details are not flowing into the datastreams you have access to, you are querying incorrectly for that prospect, they have a name that is mispelled on documentation and it confuses any searches, or half a dozen other things. However, it's always true that these individual names can be time-sinks and contribute to the 'rabbit-hole' problem.""",,,

5,"""Formatting Timesink""","""Communication""","Formatting can be a huge timesink, especially when there are constant debates about format. Profiles that change format can also impact longterm data storage, because it creates an adhoc variety in the kind of data you save to the database. Worst of all, it's essentially meaningless work that is only noticeable when something is glaringly wrong, or people have picadillos. The simple answer, in my opinion, would be to automate formatting, or use something where you can explicitly get at the data while preserving metadata. Markdown seems like a better option, because you can export to word, pdf, whatever, and easily extract the text with automated tools... there is a massive issue with creating the profile in word or as a pdf first, and then later uploading the profile to the database. The information should be structured and added to the database, and then the profiles generated.",,,
