* Used PowerQuery to attempt to filter out various fundraising specific job titles from the CMAP data (Nature paper on this dataset was published in 2025).

  - 3500+ instances of 100+ job titles in the prospect development dataset, across all sectors. Curious how close that is to an actual workforce estimate for prospect dev as a field in 2017
  - - Going to add a front-line fundraiser dataset soon
