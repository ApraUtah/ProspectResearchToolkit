A compilation of some of my favorite resources / comments / things I've learned from PRSPCT-L. 




#### References
I've included links to the posts, so you can follow the original conversation. Not sure how folks would like me to attribute their contributions, so in lieu of posting names / job titles here, I figure folks can follow the links and log into PRSPCT-L to thank folks directly. In every case, I am transforming the content somehow, not directly quoting.
