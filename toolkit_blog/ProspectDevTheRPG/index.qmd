# Designing a Hybrid RPG / Simulation Game for Prospect Development

Using Stardew Valley as the template, though this game will not have fancy GUI or anything at first. Maybe a mostly text-based game to start, like Zork.
The outlines below are partially generated with Copilot, to help me organize things.

## ✅ Step 1: Define the Core Goal
Your game should teach players about **prospect development**—the process of researching, analyzing, and managing donor prospects for fundraising. The goal might be:
- Understand donor data sources
- Learn wealth screening and analytics
- Practice prioritizing prospects for campaigns

---

## ✅ Step 2: Identify Player Roles
Here are some roles you could include:
- **Prospect Researcher**: Gathers data on donors.
- **Data Analyst**: Interprets wealth screening and engagement metrics.
- **Gift Officer**: Uses research to cultivate relationships.
- **Data Governance Specialist**: Ensures compliance and data quality.

Each role could have unique abilities and responsibilities.

---

## ✅ Step 3: Core Mechanics
Think of mechanics that simulate real-world tasks:
- **Data Gathering**: Players collect donor info from fictional sources (CRM, public records).
- **Screening & Scoring**: Assign wealth scores, engagement scores.
- **Portfolio Management**: Decide which prospects to prioritize.
- **Risk & Compliance**: Handle scenarios like missing data or privacy issues.
- **Campaign Strategy**: Allocate resources for fundraising goals.

---

## ✅ Step 4: Game Loop
A simple loop could be:
1. **Receive a fundraising goal** (e.g., \$500K for a scholarship fund).
2. **Analyze prospect pool** (data cards with wealth, affinity, engagement).
3. **Make strategic decisions** (who to prioritize, what info to research).
4. **Execute actions** (research, outreach, stewardship).
5. **Evaluate outcome** (did you hit the goal? Were resources used efficiently?).

---

## ✅ Step 5: Progression & Rewards
- **Levels**: Start with small campaigns, progress to major gifts.
- **Resources**: Time, budget, staff capacity.
- **Score Metrics**: Accuracy of research, ROI, compliance adherence.

---

## ✅ Step 6: Educational Layer
- After each decision, show **feedback**:
  - Why a choice was good or bad.
  - Real-world best practice tips.
- Include **mini-challenges** like:
  - “Spot the data quality issue”
  - “Rank these prospects by likelihood to give”

---

## ✅ Step 7: Placeholder for Fundraising Context
You can integrate realistic scenarios:
- Annual fund vs. major gifts
- Wealth screening vendors
- Ethical considerations in prospect research

---

## ✅ Step 8: Save & Load Game State
- **Export**: Allow players to download their current game state as a single `.json` file.
- **Import**: Enable players to upload the `.json` file to resume progress.
- **Structure**: JSON should include:
  - Player role and stats
  - Current campaign and goals
  - Prospect pool and decisions made
  - Resources (time, budget)
  - Progression level


---

# Technical Architecture Overview (Static Site)

## 1. Hosting
- **Platform**: GitHub Pages
- **Rendering**: Quarto for documentation and static content
- **Goal**: Fully client-side, no backend dependencies

---

## 2. Frontend
- **Language**: JavaScript (browser-based)
- **UI Framework**: Start with text-based interface; later integrate Observable JS for interactive charts or dashboards
- **Core Responsibilities**:
  - Render game state (text or simple UI)
  - Handle user actions (buttons, choices)
  - Trigger save/load functionality (JSON export/import)

---

## 3. Game State Management
- **Format**: Single `.json` file
- **Contents**:
  - Player role and stats
  - Current campaign and goals
  - Prospect pool and decisions made
  - Resources (time, budget)
  - Progression level
- **Operations**:
  - **Export**: Convert current state to JSON and trigger download
  - **Import**: Read uploaded JSON and restore state
- **Implementation**:
  - Use `FileReader` API for upload
  - Use `Blob` + `URL.createObjectURL` for download

---

## 4. Optional Enhancements
- **Observable JS**: For interactive charts and dashboards
- **Shiny Integration**: Possible, but would require server-side R, so not recommended for pure static hosting
- **Quarto**: Use for rendering documentation and embedding JS game logic in HTML pages

---

## 5. Why This Works
- Entire game runs in the browser
- No server-side code needed
- Easy to deploy and maintain on GitHub Pages

---

# Text-Based Prototype Flow (Playable Outline)

## Start Screen
- Welcome message: "Welcome to Prospect Quest!"
- Options:
  - [Start New Game]
  - [Load Game from JSON]

---

## Role Selection
- Choose your role:
  - 1. Prospect Researcher
  - 2. Data Analyst
  - 3. Gift Officer
  - 4. Data Governance Specialist

---

## Campaign Setup
- Display: "Your first campaign goal: Raise \$50,000 for the Annual Fund."
- Resources:
  - Time: 40 hours
  - Budget: \$1,000
- Prospect Pool:
  - Prospect A: Wealth Score 80, Engagement 60
  - Prospect B: Wealth Score 40, Engagement 90
  - Prospect C: Wealth Score 70, Engagement 30

---

## Player Actions (Turn-Based)
- Options:
  - [Research Prospect] (costs time)
  - [Screen Prospect] (improves score accuracy)
  - [Prioritize Prospect] (adds to portfolio)
  - [Allocate Budget] (boosts outreach success)
  - [End Turn]

---

## Feedback Example
- After prioritizing Prospect A:
  - "Prospect A added to portfolio. High wealth score makes them a strong candidate."
- After campaign ends:
  - "You raised \$48,000. Great job! Missed goal by \$2,000. Consider improving engagement scoring."

---

## Save/Load
- [Export Game State to JSON]
- [Import Game State from JSON]
