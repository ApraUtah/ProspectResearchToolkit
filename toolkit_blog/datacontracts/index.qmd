# Creating Internal Data Contracts: A Practical Guide

## Introduction
As organizations grow, data becomes increasingly complex and distributed across multiple teams and systems. Without clear agreements on how data is structured, maintained, and shared, teams risk miscommunication, broken pipelines, and unreliable analytics. **Internal data contracts** solve this problem by formalizing expectations between data producers and consumers—similar to API contracts, but for data.

This post will cover:
- What internal data contracts are
- A sample contract template
- Best practices for implementation
- How they can apply to fundraising analysis teams

## What is an Internal Data Contract?
An internal data contract is a documented agreement that defines:
- **Schema**: The structure and types of data fields
- **Quality guarantees**: Rules for completeness, accuracy, and freshness
- **Ownership**: Who is responsible for producing and consuming the data
- **Access and security**: Permissions and compliance requirements
- **Change management**: How updates are communicated and versioned

These contracts reduce breakages, improve trust, and enable scalable data sharing across teams.

## Sample Internal Data Contract Template

**Title:** Customer Data Contract  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Owner:** Data Engineering Team  
**Effective Date:** 2025-11-12  

---

### 1. Purpose
This contract defines the structure, quality, and governance of the `customer` dataset shared between the **CRM system** (producer) and **Analytics team** (consumer).

---

### 2. Schema Definition
| Field Name      | Data Type   | Nullable | Description                  |
|-----------------|------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| customer_id     | STRING     | No       | Unique customer identifier |
| name            | STRING     | No       | Full name of the customer  |
| email           | STRING     | No       | Customer email address     |
| signup_date     | DATE       | No       | Date of account creation   |
| status          | STRING     | Yes      | Active, Inactive, Pending  |

**Versioning:**  
- Backward-compatible changes allowed (adding new nullable fields).  
- Breaking changes require **30-day notice** and version increment.

---

### 3. Data Quality Guarantees
- **Freshness:** Data updated within 15 minutes of CRM changes.  
- **Completeness:** 99% of records must have `email` populated.  
- **Accuracy:** `status` must match CRM system values.

---

### 4. Ownership & Responsibilities
- **Producer:** CRM Engineering Team  
- **Consumer:** Analytics Team  
- **Escalation:** Contact `data-support@company.com` for issues.

---

### 5. Access & Security
- Data accessible via internal data warehouse with role-based permissions.  
- PII fields (e.g., email) must comply with GDPR and internal privacy policies.

---

### 6. Change Management
- All schema changes documented in the internal data catalog.  
- Breaking changes require approval from both producer and consumer teams.

## Best Practices for Internal Data Contracts

1. **Start Simple, Iterate**
   Begin with critical datasets and expand as adoption grows.

2. **Use Versioning**
   Always version schemas to avoid breaking downstream systems.

3. **Automate Validation**
   Implement automated checks for schema compliance and data quality.

4. **Centralize Documentation**
   Maintain contracts in a shared repository or data catalog for visibility.

5. **Define SLAs**
   Include clear expectations for freshness, completeness, and uptime.

6. **Communicate Changes Early**
   Use automated alerts or Slack notifications for schema updates.

7. **Enforce Ownership**
   Assign clear owners for both producer and consumer sides.

8. **Integrate with CI/CD**
   Validate data contracts during deployment to catch issues before production.

9. **Monitor & Audit**
   Track compliance and log violations for continuous improvement.

10. **Align with Governance**
    Ensure contracts comply with regulatory and internal security standards.
