Working to make quizzes, flashcards, and discussion questions that can used for prospect development conferences. 

In the future, may also have a "Portfolio building game" where you play as a prospect manager, researcher, or fundraiser - a simple RPG that uses the artificial donor dataset (still needs to be built) as the backend. Instead of being a simple quiz, you essentially solve problems via your character, you can upgrade your prospect development shop, but the bigger the institution the more obstacles show up and the more challenging it gets. It's highly simplified, so it is useable in conferences (e.g. take 10 minutes to play as a team).

For now, I'm building all the pieces, like the actual knowledge base and obstacles that will eventually be incorporated by the RPG.
