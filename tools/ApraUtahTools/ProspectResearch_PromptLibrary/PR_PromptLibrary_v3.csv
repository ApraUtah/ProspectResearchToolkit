PROMPT-011|Instructional|Checking a profile based on a custom styleguide|Proofing||Copilot|Partially Successful|2025-10-31|"I have a helper file in markdown format that includes all the style and content details for every kind of profile we produce. I was testing out this helper file to see how it worked checking Word fonts with Copilot. It failed to detect a wrong font at first because of how Calibri is represented on the metadata level of Word docs as a default. If the user has not changed their default font, Copilot said it can't detect Calibri. Or it was just a classic AI mistake. In any case, when I changed my default font using the Design tab, and manually changed a few other sentences, and then told it specifically to look for fonts that I don't want... it correctly identified the fonts and lines they were on. All of this is kind of silly, since profiles should just be generated automatically from database information, not fiddled with like hand - but that's the way it is for some shops right now, even still. The helper file needs to be much more specific, and maybe if would help if instead of just having the details of what's supposed to be in the profile and how it's formatted, the file should have a 2-round process, where it first checks for content, then checks for formatting, with smaller steps within those processes when necessary. I think it's possible to make a ""proofer module"" that exists as one piece of the helper file, and doesn't have to stand on it's own."
