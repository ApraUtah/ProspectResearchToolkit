**Version: {{< var version >}}**

This is an online research toolkit, taking inspiration from [Bellingcat's Online Investigative Toolkit](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit){.external} as a way to establish a community-driven library of helpful resources. Bellingcat's toolkit is intended for investigative journalists, a world not disimilar to our own as prospect researchers, so it serves as a solid touchstone. 

As one of my colleagues once pointed out, prospect research can seem like "panning for gold" - an apt metaphor, because you can pan for gold by hand (e.g. individual data validations for 1 specific person) or on an industrial level (e.g. segmenting and rating thousands of names for future research). The theme of this toolkit, aesthetically, is "Prospectin' in Philanthropy Country" - and hopefully adds some color / whimsy to what might otherwise be a somewhat boring website!

## Goals
Create high quality prospect research education and tools available to big shops and small shops alike.

### Short-term
- Synthetic donor dataset for training, examples, and presentations
- AI Prompt library and use-cases, as well as "helper files" for creating stronger research posture without having to initialize an entire agent
- Software tool comparisons, paid and free
- Templates and tutorials

### Long-term
- Extensions or add-ins, or community plugins (potentially starting with Obsidian or Excel)
- Standalone app that integrates with free and paid tools
- Collaboration with other Apra chapters and Apra International
