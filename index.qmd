As one of my colleagues once described a specific research process as "panning for gold" - because the filtering process was not necessarily going to yield anything but a few flecks of valuable information or names.
I liked the metaphor enough that I've incorporated panning for gold into the aesthetics of this toolkit. But not everyone has the budget for the same equipment, or the time to create tools themselves, which can be frustrating if you are a one-person shop expected to "do more with less."

## Goals
Create high quality, community-driven, prospect research education and tools - and keep them free to use forever.

### Short-term
- Synthetic donor dataset for training, examples, and presentations
- AI Prompt library and use-cases, as well as "helper files" for creating stronger research posture without having to initialize an entire agent
- Software tool comparisons, paid and free
- Templates and tutorials

### Long-term
- Extensions or add-ins, or community plugins (potentially starting with Obsidian or Excel)
- Standalone app that integrates with free and paid tools
- Collaboration with other Apra chapters and Apra International
- A prospect research field guide that combines tools, blog posts, tutorials, and edcuation into one cohesive whole - and can be downloaded as PDF as well as read online

- Toolkit structure aiming to take notes from [Bellingcat's Online Investigative Toolkit](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit){.external} as a way to establish a community-driven library of helpful resources. Bellingcat's toolkit is intended for investigative journalists, a world not disimilar to our own as prospect researchers, so it serves as a solid touchstone.
