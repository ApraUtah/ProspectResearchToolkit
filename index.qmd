Howdy, partner. Welcome to camp!

You know how they say, "there's gold in them thar hills?" - well, I've set out to create the resource I always wish existed: a free, community-driven library of tools for the scrappy fundraising prospector, along with a field guide to put all of them into practice. 

I hope this toolkit will expand to be an invaluable resource for those splashing through the data streams, Excel sluice boxes and CRM picks a'clankin'!

For more info about the who, what, where, and why...feel free to check out the [About](about.qmd) page.

Thanks for reading and happy trails.
