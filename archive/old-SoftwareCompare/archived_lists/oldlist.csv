It seems intended more for law firms hoping to find new clients and keep track of ongoing cindustry info, band it's unclear if anyone in fundraising uses Radar for this purpose. My guess is it's too expensive for a more rare use-case, and other tools (like the legal side of Lexis) maybe do a better job or are more familiar.
