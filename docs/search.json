    "text": "Use-cases\nYour workflow may not require PowerQuery, it may be overkill. But given how much fiddling with Excel formulas can happen, and how that can eat up time, PowerQuery honestly seems like it should be more standard in our field - especially because of how reproducible any given process is - the steps being recorded automatically so they could be reused or made into a template.\n\nScenario 1\nYou have data in your CRM that you want to combine with another dataset you’ve found or created. For example, perhaps you’ve created a custom list of individuals who have won awards, but have not updated each of their individual profiles in the database yet. So you are looking to add this supplemental info to help segment a list in an interesting way.\n\n\nSteps to Achieve This\n\nExport Data from CRM: Start by exporting the relevant data from your CRM into a CSV or Excel format.\nImport Data into Power Query: Open Excel, go to the Data tab, and select “Get Data” to import your CRM data and your custom dataset.\nCombine Datasets: Use Power Query tools to merge or append the datasets based on a common identifier.\nTransform Data: Clean, filter, or reshape the data as necessary.\nLoad the Combined Data: Once satisfied with the combined data, load it back into Excel for analysis or reporting.\n\nMore complex data engineering can be done with PowerQuery, and business intelligence analytics with PowerBI"

    "text": "Why does this exist?\nThere are plenty of excellent paid resources available—Apra, private consultants, subscription tools, books—but not everyone has the budget to access them. This field guide is being created to fill that gap. It’s a free, practical guide for researchers who want to learn the ropes, sharpen their skills, and explore the technical side of prospecting without breaking the bank. While some chapters cover beginner-friendly tools and techniques, others dive into more advanced territory—things like building donor personas, interpreting affinity scores, using AI agents, and navigating CRMs.\nWhether you’re a solo researcher juggling multiple roles or part of a larger team looking to modernize your approach, this guide is meant to be flexible, accessible, and useful across a wide range of experience levels. It’s also designed to be a living document, updated regularly to reflect changes in software, strategy, and the broader landscape of philanthropy. Like the Apra Utah GitHub / Prospect Research Toolkit, the philosophy behind this guide is rooted in open-source thinking and community-driven learning."

The toolkit and field guide are essentially empty, right now, which makes this website seem a little silly - but I’m hard at work getting stuff ready to flesh out the toolkit and guide."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I wanted to explore a few issues of data privacy as they affect your average prospect development, management, or research professional.\nThis toolkit, at least in the alpha stages, will be focused on tools that are available / compliant in the USA, simply because that’s where I am based. Some resources mentioned here may not be available internationally, or may be subject to stricter privacy laws.\nProspect researchers take ethics very seriously, and some of the tools or methods that are available in America - or some of the more experimental proactive research I prototype in this toolkit - may not be appropriate for every organization.\nThese days, donor trust on an institutional level can be hard to gain and easy to lose. We exist in a difficult data privacy environment, where many competing interests are involved. I once had a job where leadership jokingly started referring to us prospect research and dev folks as “stalkers”, including, to my horror, in the presence of donors that happened to be touring the building.\nI had to eventually step up in a meeting and attempt to explain that it was really a short-sighted way of getting a laugh, considering the damage it could cause to morale and with donor relations. Being a lowly analyst, I tried to be diplomatic - and hopefully succeeded. But the incident stands out in my mind as a good example of the natural tension that exists in prospect research: we need to be experts on donors, which means having an expert handle on donor data. We must use our expertise that complies with institutional bylaws, legal requirements, and the standards spelled out by our professional organizations.\nEven when we are doing our best, however, those efforts may be perceived as invasive or inappropriate. It’s easy to reframe the conversation with ourselves, of course, because we believe in the mission of our organization. Philanthropy benefits many stakeholders, but we also exist in a competitive funding environment, which means we have to chase down leads to a certain extent - before passing them on to front-line fundraisers.\nStill, there is a natural tension in our jobs - and one that merits discussion every year, as technology and laws change.\n\n\nIn May 2025, LexisNexis had a data breach that originated from an attacker accessing their Github account. Data breaches are unfortunately common, but they are also a smaller issue compared to the larger questions they tend to evoke: what info IS ethical to gather about individuals? Just because something is available, does not mean that it is ethical to use… of course, there is an interesting wrinkle to the digital ecosystem in which prospect researchers attempt to apply ethics: data brokers are not just vulnerable to breaches, they actively purchase or scrape breach data themselves.\nBreach data is sometimes considered “public”, but that definition is used loosely by companies, similar to how AI companies have scraped both copywrighted works and public items on the internet - through a variety of means - with the argument that their final product is transformative enough to dodge legal challenges.\nOne fascinating aspect of the fundraising industry is the fact that many of us tend to use tools (like LexisNexis) that live somewhat in the heart of an unfolding controversy - an ongoing worldwide conversation that can get quite heated. Don’t get me wrong, I love using LexisNexis, but it’s important to understand the technology we use, and to vet how data is curated. Ultimately, we don’t have much power as analysts to impact these discussions, but it can help us gain fidelity in our understanding of the waters in which we swim - and when there is less mystery, even if we don’t always like what we find, I think it can give a measure of confidence when making decisions.\nThere are countless round tables and think pieces and meetings about compliance, of course, that dig deeper into these issues - but I think it’s important to point out the tensions or stressors that exist in a job.\n\n\n\nIt’s hard to be a circumspect prospect researcher and abide by the ethos of “data minimalism” - the minimum viable amount of data to complete a research project on a prospective donor - when we swim in an ocean of tools and companies that rely on data maximalism as their core business model.\n\n\n\nFor prospect researchers, they may feel conflicted about using AI tools or platforms that collate information from data brokers with black box methods that are subject to legal scrutiny (e.g. data privacy laws in California, or Europe).\nResearch is not always a cold, logical, straightforward deal. I mean, when I first started as a prospect development analyst…I would find that reading too many obituaries in one day would make me feel kinda rough, especially if they were for individuals near my own age.\nWhat we research, and how we research, can have downstream effects on our moods– positive or negative. Curiosity, for example, is an example of a positive trait that I think can accompany positive moods while researching - research can be quite fun! Alternatively, getting bogged down in a research rabbit hole without finding the answer to your key research question…while competing deadlines threaten to derail the session…not fun.\nSome folks are better at managing the “research posture”, the way one mentally approaches the job, and I think it’s one of the key skills that blends both hard and soft skills.\nWhat does this have to do with data privacy? Well, being compliant and training in ethics affects our research posture and how we react to different tools, use-cases, requests, or situations.\nIn some cases, you may be put in a position where you are requested to find information about a donor that crosses a line - a request that often happens by accident - and it’s important to understand your job well enough to educate others, even your supervisors sometimes, about the lines in the sand."
