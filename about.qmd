This toolkit is maintained by [Greg Brooks](https://github.com/analyst-greg/){.external} in association with [Apra Utah](https://aprautah.wildapricot.org/){.external}.

# Short-term Goals
- Synthetic donor dataset for training, examples, and presentations
- AI Prompt library and use-cases, as well as "helper files" for creating stronger research posture without having to initialize an entire agent
- Software tool comparisons, paid and free
- Templates
- Tutorials and Blog posts that will be refined and compiled into the field guide: [*"Prospectin' in Philanthropy Country"*](toolkit_blog/technical_field_guide/index.qmd)

***
# Long-term Goals
- Extensions or add-ins, or community plugins (potentially starting with Obsidian or Excel)
- Standalone app that integrates with free and paid tools
- Collaboration with other Apra chapters and Apra International
- A completed prospect research field guide that combines tools, blog posts, tutorials, and education into one cohesive whole - and can be downloaded as PDF as well as read online
- Sponsorship, to have budget for custom domain and/or server

# FAQ

## Why does this exist?

There are plenty of excellent paid resources available: Apra, private consultants, subscription tools, books, but not everyone has the budget to access them. This toolkit is being created to bridge that gap, or supplement what's already out there, not to replace any of those things. The goal is to keep it simple, open-source, community-driven, free and regularly updated.

## Who is this guy anyway?

I come from a psychology background and am largely self-taught in data analytics, information science, data science, etc. So keep an eye out for mistakes, and feel free to let me by [raising an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue) on our (Github issue page)[https://github.com/ApraUtah/ProspectResearchToolkit/issues].

## How often is the website updated?

In small ways, frequently! Larger changes and resources are on a slower schedule, since I'm doing this in my free time. I expect to have more tutorials, resources, and tools online by 2026. [Click here](https://github.com/orgs/ApraUtah/projects/1) to see the features / goals currently being worked on!

## How is Apra Utah involved?

I started this website as part of my education initiative for 2025 while I'm serving on the Apra Utah board. In the future (e.g. when I figure out how to do it without breaking too many things) the repository and website name will be changed to a more general one, with participating Apra chapters listed on the website's About page. The dream would be to have an open-source collective of contributors / volunteers who help maintain the project and add to its longevity, since right now it is almost entirely a one-man show.
