This toolkit is maintained by [Greg Brooks](https://github.com/analyst-greg/){.external} in association with [Apra Utah](https://aprautah.wildapricot.org/){.external}.

# Short-term Goals
- Synthetic donor dataset for training, examples, and presentations
- AI Prompt library and use-cases, as well as "helper files" for creating stronger research posture without having to initialize an entire agent
- Software tool comparisons, paid and free
- Templates
- Tutorials and Blog posts that will be refined and compiled into the field guide: [*"Prospectin' in Philanthropy Country"*](toolkit_blog/technical_field_guide/index.qmd)

***
# Long-term Goals
- Extensions or add-ins, or community plugins (potentially starting with Obsidian or Excel)
- Standalone app that integrates with free and paid tools
- Collaboration with other Apra chapters and Apra International
- A completed prospect research field guide that combines tools, blog posts, tutorials, and edcuation into one cohesive whole - and can be downloaded as PDF as well as read online
- Sponsorship, to have budget for custom domain and/or server

# FAQ

## Why does this exist?

There are plenty of excellent paid resources available—Apra, private consultants, subscription tools, books—but not everyone has the budget to access them. This field guide is being created to fill that gap. It’s a free, practical guide for researchers who want to learn the ropes, sharpen their skills, and explore the technical side of prospecting without breaking the bank.
While some chapters cover beginner-friendly tools and techniques, others dive into more advanced territory—things like building donor personas, interpreting affinity scores, using AI agents, and navigating CRMs. 

Whether you're a solo researcher juggling multiple roles or part of a larger team looking to modernize your approach, this guide is meant to be flexible, accessible, and useful across a wide range of experience levels. It’s also designed to be a living document, updated regularly to reflect changes in software, strategy, and the broader landscape of philanthropy. Like the Apra Utah GitHub / Prospect Research Toolkit, the philosophy behind this guide is rooted in open-source thinking and community-driven learning.

## Who is this guy anyway?

I come from a psychology background and am largely self-taught in data analytics, information science, data science, etc. That means there are probably some big gaps in my knowledge and skills—which is why I'm hoping to collaborate with others to expand this field guide and toolkit. 

Right now, I'm really happy that I finally figured out how to deploy this Quarto website via GitHub pages, and am making progress in refining it's simple structure. The toolkit and field guide are essentially empty, right now, which makes this website seem a little silly - but I'm hard at work getting stuff ready to flesh out the toolkit and guide.

- Toolkit structure aiming to take notes from [Bellingcat's Online Investigative Toolkit](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit){.external} as a way to establish a community-driven library of helpful resources. Bellingcat's toolkit is intended for investigative journalists, a world not disimilar to our own as prospect researchers, so it serves as a solid touchstone.
