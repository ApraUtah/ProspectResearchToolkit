This toolkit is maintained by [Greg Brooks](https://github.com/analyst-greg/){.external} in association with [Apra Utah](https://aprautah.wildapricot.org/){.external}.

### Short-term Goals
- Synthetic donor dataset for training, examples, and presentations
- AI Prompt library and use-cases, as well as "helper files" for creating stronger research posture without having to initialize an entire agent
- Software tool comparisons, paid and free
- Templates
- Tutorials and Blog posts that will be refined and compiled into the field guide: *"Prospectin' in Philanthropy Country"*

***
### Long-term
- Extensions or add-ins, or community plugins (potentially starting with Obsidian or Excel)
- Standalone app that integrates with free and paid tools
- Collaboration with other Apra chapters and Apra International
- A completed prospect research field guide that combines tools, blog posts, tutorials, and edcuation into one cohesive whole - and can be downloaded as PDF as well as read online
- Sponsorship, to have budget for custom domain and/or server

- Toolkit structure aiming to take notes from [Bellingcat's Online Investigative Toolkit](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit){.external} as a way to establish a community-driven library of helpful resources. Bellingcat's toolkit is intended for investigative journalists, a world not disimilar to our own as prospect researchers, so it serves as a solid touchstone.
